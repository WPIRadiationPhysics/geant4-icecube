P. Gumplinger. Optical Photon Processes in Geant4. Users Workshop at SLAC (slides); Feb 2002.

- G4OpticalPhoton data type
  - No smooth physics transition to G4Gamma. 
  - Can define spin vector class attribute (code on slide 2)
- Native Geant4 optical photon features
  - Automatic cerenkov and scintillation production
  - Refraction and reflection processes
  - Bulk absorption
  - Rayleigh scattering
- Enabling optical features
  - Must define material absorption and relfection in G4DetectorConstruction
  - Given as discrete list in terms of energies (code on slide 4)
- Cerenkov Processes
  - Occurs when v_particle > v_group of light in medium
  - Photons emitted off surface of cone
  - Decreased particle speed results in
    - Decreased cone angle
    - Decreased photon count
    - Increased photon energy
  - Photon spin vector normal to cone surface
